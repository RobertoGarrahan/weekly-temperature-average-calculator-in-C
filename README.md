# Weekly Temperature Average Calculator

This project is a simple C program developed during the first days of my Computer Science degree.

The program asks the user to input the temperature for each day of the week, calculates the average temperature, and counts how many days had a temperature higher than 27°C.

The main goal of this project was to practice:
- Basic C syntax
- Loops (`for`)
- Conditional statements (`if`)
- User input and output

This is an introductory project and intentionally kept simple, representing an early step in learning programming fundamentals.

## Technologies
- C
- Standard C Library (`stdio.h`)
